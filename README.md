# wordpress
Prerequisites
An Ubuntu 22.04 VPS (we’ll be using our SSD 2 VPS plan)
deployment for wordpress 
Step 1 – Installing the Nginx Web Server
To display web pages to site visitors, you’re going to employ Nginx, a high-performance web server. You’ll use the APT package manager to obtain this software.

Since this is your first time using apt for this session, start off by updating your server’s package index:

sudo apt update
Following that, run apt install to install Nginx:

sudo apt install nginx
When prompted, press Y and ENTER to confirm that you want to install Nginx. Once the installation is finished, the Nginx web server will be active and running on your Ubuntu 22.04 server.

If you have the ufw firewall enabled, as recommended in our initial server setup guide, you will need to allow connections to Nginx. Nginx registers a few different UFW application profiles upon installation. To check which UFW profiles are available, run:

sudo ufw app list
Output
Available applications:
  Nginx Full
  Nginx HTTP
  Nginx HTTPS
  OpenSSH
It is recommended that you enable the most restrictive profile that will still allow the traffic you need. Since you haven’t configured SSL for your server in this guide, you will only need to allow regular HTTP traffic on port 80.

Enable this by running the following:

sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
You can verify the change by checking the status:

sudo ufw status
This output displays that HTTP traffic is now allowed:

Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
With the new firewall rule added, you can test if the server is up and running by accessing your server’s domain name or public IP address in your web browser.

If you do not have a domain name pointed at your server and you do not know your server’s public IP address, you can find it by running either of the following commands:

ip addr show
hostname -I
This will print out a few IP addresses. You can try each of them in turn in your web browser.

As an alternative, you can check which IP address is accessible, as viewed from other locations on the internet:

curl -4 icanhazip.com
Write the address that you receive in your web browser and it will take you to Nginx’s default landing page:

http://server_domain_or_IP
Nginx default page

If you receive this page, it means you have successfully installed Nginx and enabled HTTP traffic for your web server.

Step 2 — Installing MySQL
Now that you have a web server up and running, you need to install the database system to store and manage data for your site. MySQL is a popular database management system used within PHP environments.

Again, use apt to acquire and install this software:

sudo apt install mysql-server
When prompted, confirm installation by pressing Y, and then ENTER.

When the installation is finished, it’s recommended that you run a security script that comes pre-installed with MySQL. This script will remove some insecure default settings and lock down access to your database system. Start the interactive script by running the following command:

sudo mysql_secure_installation
You will be prompted with a question asking if you want to configure the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN.

Note: Enabling this feature is something of a judgment call. If enabled, passwords which don’t match the specified criteria will be rejected by MySQL with an error. It is safe to leave validation disabled, but you should always use strong, unique passwords for database credentials.

Answer Y for yes, or anything else to continue without enabling:

Output
VALIDATE PASSWORD COMPONENT can be used to test passwords
and improve security. It checks the strength of password
and allows the users to set only those passwords which are
secure enough. Would you like to setup VALIDATE PASSWORD component?

Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No: 
If you answer “yes”, you’ll be asked to select a level of password validation. Keep in mind that if you enter 2 for the strongest level, you will receive errors when attempting to set any password that does not contain numbers, upper and lowercase letters, and special characters:

Output
There are three levels of password validation policy:

LOW    Length >= 8
MEDIUM Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, and special characters
STRONG Length >= 8, numeric, mixed case, special characters and dictionary              file

Please enter 0 = LOW, 1 = MEDIUM and 2 = STRONG: 1
Regardless of whether you chose to set up the VALIDATE PASSWORD PLUGIN, your server will ask you to select and confirm a password for the MySQL root user. This is not to be confused with the system root. The database root user is an administrative user with full privileges over the database system. Even though the default authentication method for the MySQL root user dispenses the use of a password, even when one is set, you should define a strong password here as an additional safety measure. We’ll talk about this in a moment.

If you enabled password validation, you’ll be shown the password strength for the root password you entered and your server will ask if you want to continue with that password. If you are happy with your current password, press Y for “yes” at the prompt:

Output
Estimated strength of the password: 100 
Do you wish to continue with the password provided?(Press y|Y for Yes, any other key for No) : y
For the rest of the questions, press Y and hit the ENTER key at each prompt. This will remove some anonymous users and the test database, disable remote root logins, and load these new rules so that MySQL immediately respects the changes you have made.

When you’re finished, test if you’re able to log in to the MySQL console:

sudo mysql
This will connect to the MySQL server as the administrative database user root, which is inferred by the use of sudo when running this command. You should receive the following output:

Output
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 10
Server version: 8.0.28-0ubuntu4 (Ubuntu)

Copyright (c) 2000, 2022, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
owners.

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

mysql>
To exit the MySQL console,write the following:

exit
Notice that you didn’t need to provide a password to connect as the root user, even though you have defined one when running the mysql_secure_installation script. This is because, when installed on Ubuntu, the default authentication method for the administrative MySQL user is auth_socket, rather than with a method that uses a password. This may seem like a security concern at first, but it makes the database server more secure since the only users allowed to log in as the root MySQL user are the system users with sudo privileges connecting from the console or through an application running with the same privileges. In practical terms, that means you won’t be able to use the administrative database root user to connect from your PHP application.

For increased security, it’s best to have dedicated user accounts with less expansive privileges set up for every database, especially if you plan on having multiple databases hosted on your server.

Note: Certain older releases of the native MySQL PHP library mysqlnd don’t support caching_sha2_authentication, the default authentication method for created users MySQL 8. For that reason, when creating database users for PHP applications on MySQL 8, you may need to make sure they’re configured to use mysql_native_password instead. We’ll demonstrate how to do that in Step 6.

Your MySQL server is now installed and secured. Next, you’ll install PHP, the final component in the LEMP stack.

Step 3 – Installing PHP
You have Nginx installed to serve your content and MySQL installed to store and manage your data. Now you can install PHP to process code and generate dynamic content for the web server.

While Apache embeds the PHP interpreter in each request, Nginx requires an external program to handle PHP processing and act as a bridge between the PHP interpreter itself and the web server. This allows for better overall performance in most PHP-based websites, but it requires additional configuration. You’ll need to install php8.1-fpm, which stands for “PHP fastCGI process manager” and uses the current version of PHP (at the time of writing), to tell Nginx to pass PHP requests to this software for processing. Additionally, you’ll need php-mysql, a PHP module that allows PHP to communicate with MySQL-based databases. Core PHP packages will automatically be installed as dependencies.

To install the php8.1-fpm and php-mysql packages, run:

sudo apt install php8.1-fpm php-mysql
When prompted, press Y and ENTER to confirm the installation.

You now have your PHP components installed. Next, you’ll configure Nginx to use them.

Step 4 — Configuring Nginx to Use the PHP Processor
When using the Nginx web server, we can create server blocks (similar to virtual hosts in Apache) to encapsulate configuration details and host more than one domain on a single server. In this guide, we’ll use your_domain as an example domain name.

Info: To learn more about setting up a domain name with DigitalOcean, read our introduction to DigitalOcean DNS.

On Ubuntu 22.04, Nginx has one server block enabled by default and is configured to serve documents out of a directory at /var/www/html. While this works well for a single site, it can become difficult to manage if you are hosting multiple sites. Instead of modifying /var/www/html, we’ll create a directory structure within /var/www for the your_domain website, leaving /var/www/html in place as the default directory to be served if a client request doesn’t match any other sites.

Create the root web directory for your_domain as follows:

sudo mkdir /var/www/your_domain
Next, assign ownership of the directory with the $USER environment variable, which will reference your current system user:

sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/your_domain
Then, open a new configuration file in Nginx’s sites-available directory using your preferred command-line editor. Here, we’ll use nano:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain
This will create a new blank file. Insert the following bare-bones configuration:

/etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your_domain www.your_domain;
    root /var/www/your_domain;

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
     }

    location ~ /\.ht {
        deny all;
    }

}
Here’s what each of these directives and location blocks do:

listen — Defines what port Nginx will listen on. In this case, it will listen on port 80, the default port for HTTP.
root — Defines the document root where the files served by this website are stored.
index — Defines in which order Nginx will prioritize index files for this website. It is a common practice to list index.html files with higher precedence than index.php files to allow for quickly setting up a maintenance landing page in PHP applications. You can adjust these settings to better suit your application needs.
server_name — Defines which domain names and/or IP addresses this server block should respond for. Point this directive to your server’s domain name or public IP address.
location / — The first location block includes a try_files directive, which checks for the existence of files or directories matching a URL request. If Nginx cannot find the appropriate resource, it will return a 404 error.
location ~ \.php$ — This location block handles the actual PHP processing by pointing Nginx to the fastcgi-php.conf configuration file and the php8.1-fpm.sock file, which declares what socket is associated with php8.1-fpm.
location ~ /\.ht — The last location block deals with .htaccess files, which Nginx does not process. By adding the deny all directive, if any .htaccess files happen to find their way into the document root, they will not be served to visitors.
When you’re done editing, save and close the file. If you’re using nano, you can do so by pressing CTRL+X and then Y and ENTER to confirm.

Activate your configuration by linking to the configuration file from Nginx’s sites-enabled directory:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your_domain /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
Then, unlink the default configuration file from the /sites-enabled/ directory:

sudo unlink /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
Note: If you ever need to restore the default configuration, you can do so by recreating the symbolic link, like the following:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
This will tell Nginx to use the configuration next time it is reloaded. You can test your configuration for syntax errors by running the following:

sudo nginx -t
If any errors are reported, go back to your configuration file to review its contents before continuing.

When you are ready, reload Nginx to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl reload nginx
Your new website is now active, but the web root /var/www/your_domain is still empty. Create an index.html file in that location so that you can test that your new server block works as expected:

nano /var/www/your_domain/index.html
Include the following content in this file:

/var/www/your_domain/index.html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>your_domain website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>This is the landing page of <strong>your_domain</strong>.</p>
  </body>
</html>
Now go to your browser and access your server’s domain name or IP address, as listed within the server_name directive in your server block configuration file:

http://server_domain_or_IP
You’ll receive a page like the following:

Nginx server block

If you receive this page, it means your Nginx server block is working as expected.

You can leave this file in place as a temporary landing page for your application until you set up an index.php file to replace it. Once you do that, remember to remove or rename the index.html file from your document root, as it would take precedence over an index.php file by default.

Your LEMP stack is now fully configured. In the next step, you’ll create a PHP script to test that Nginx is in fact able to handle .php files within your newly configured website.

Step 5 –Testing PHP with Nginx
Your LEMP stack should now be completely set up. You can test it to validate that Nginx can correctly hand .php files off to your PHP processor.

You can do this by creating a test PHP file in your document root. Open a new file called info.php within your document root in your preferred text editor:

nano /var/www/your_domain/info.php
Add the following lines into the new file. This is valid PHP code that will return information about your server:

/var/www/your_domain/info.php
<?php
phpinfo();
When you are finished, save and close the file.

You can now access this page in your web browser by visiting the domain name or public IP address you’ve set up in your Nginx configuration file, followed by /info.php:

http://server_domain_or_IP/info.php
You will receive a web page containing detailed information about your server:

PHPInfo Ubuntu 22.04

After checking the relevant information about your PHP server through that page, it’s best to remove the file you created as it contains sensitive information about your PHP environment and your Ubuntu server. You can use rm to remove that file:

sudo rm /var/www/your_domain/info.php
You can always regenerate this file if you need it later.

steps for optimizing the nginx performance:
Worker Processes and Worker Connections
The first two variables we need to tune are the worker processes and worker connections. Before we jump into each setting, we need to understand what each of these directives control. The worker_processes directive is the sturdy spine of life for Nginx. This directive is responsible for letting our virtual server know how many workers to spawn once it has become bound to the proper IP and port(s). It is common practice to run 1 worker process per core. Anything above this won’t hurt your system, but it will leave idle processes usually just lying about.

To figure out what number you’ll need to set worker_processes to, simply take a look at the amount of cores you have on your setup. If you’re using the DigitalOcean 512MB setup, then it’ll probably be one core. If you end up fast resizing to a larger setup, then you’ll need to check your cores again and adjust this number accordingly. We can accomplish this by greping out the cpuinfo:

grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l
Let’s say this returns a value of 1. Then that is the amount of cores on our machine!

The worker_connections command tells our worker processes how many people can simultaneously be served by Nginx. The default value is 768; however, considering that every browser usually opens up at least 2 connections/server, this number can half. This is why we need to adjust our worker connections to its full potential. We can check our core’s limitations by issuing a ulimit command:

ulimit -n
On a smaller machine (512MB droplet) this number will probably read 1024, which is a good starting number.

Let’s update our config:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

worker_processes 1;
worker_connections 1024;
Remember, the amount of clients that can be served can be multiplied by the amount of cores. In this case, we can server 1024 clients/second. This is, however, even further mitigated by the keepalive_timeout directive.

Buffers
Another incredibly important tweak we can make is to the buffer size. If the buffer sizes are too low, then Nginx will have to write to a temporary file causing the disk to read and write constantly. There are a few directives we’ll need to understand before making any decisions.

client_body_buffer_size: This handles the client buffer size, meaning any POST actions sent to Nginx. POST actions are typically form submissions.

client_header_buffer_size: Similar to the previous directive, only instead it handles the client header size. For all intents and purposes, 1K is usually a decent size for this directive.

client_max_body_size: The maximum allowed size for a client request. If the maximum size is exceeded, then Nginx will spit out a 413 error or Request Entity Too Large.

large_client_header_buffers: The maximum number and size of buffers for large client headers.

client_body_buffer_size 10K;
client_header_buffer_size 1k;
client_max_body_size 8m;
large_client_header_buffers 2 1k;
Timeouts
Timeouts can also drastically improve performance.

The client_body_timeout and client_header_timeout directives are responsible for the time a server will wait for a client body or client header to be sent after request. If neither a body or header is sent, the server will issue a 408 error or Request time out.

The keepalive_timeout assigns the timeout for keep-alive connections with the client. Simply put, Nginx will close connections with the client after this period of time.

Finally, the send_timeout is established not on the entire transfer of answer, but only between two operations of reading; if after this time client will take nothing, then Nginx is shutting down the connection.

client_body_timeout 12;
client_header_timeout 12;
keepalive_timeout 15;
send_timeout 10;
Gzip Compression
Gzip can help reduce the amount of network transfer Nginx deals with. However, be careful increasing the gzip_comp_level too high as the server will begin wasting cpu cycles.

gzip             on;
gzip_comp_level  2;
gzip_min_length  1000;
gzip_proxied     expired no-cache no-store private auth;
gzip_types       text/plain application/x-javascript text/xml text/css application/xml;
Static File Caching
It’s possible to set expire headers for files that don’t change and are served regularly. This directive can be added to the actual Nginx server block.

location ~* .(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|ico|css|js)$ {
expires 365d;
}
Add and remove any of the file types in the array above to match the types of files your Nginx servers.

Logging
Nginx logs every request that hits the VPS to a log file. If you use analytics to monitor this, you may want to turn this functionality off. Simply edit the access_log directive:

access_log off;
Save and close the file, then run:

sudo service nginx restart
steps for instaling the cerbot and generating ssl certificate for the server:
Step 1 — Installing Certbot
Certbot recommends using their snap package for installation. Snap packages work on nearly all Linux distributions, but they require that you’ve installed snapd first in order to manage snap packages. Ubuntu 22.04 comes with support for snaps out of the box, so you can start by making sure your snapd core is up to date:

sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
If you’re working on a server that previously had an older version of certbot installed, you should remove it before going any further:

sudo apt remove certbot
After that, you can install the certbot package:

sudo snap install --classic certbot
Finally, you can link the certbot command from the snap install directory to your path, so you’ll be able to run it by just typing certbot. This isn’t necessary with all packages, but snaps tend to be less intrusive by default, so they don’t conflict with any other system packages by accident:

sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
Now that we have Certbot installed, let’s run it to get our certificate.

Step 2 — Confirming Nginx’s Configuration
Certbot needs to be able to find the correct server block in your Nginx configuration for it to be able to automatically configure SSL. Specifically, it does this by looking for a server_name directive that matches the domain you request a certificate for.

If you followed the server block set up step in the Nginx installation tutorial, you should have a server block for your domain at /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com with the server_name directive already set appropriately.

To check, open the configuration file for your domain using nano or your favorite text editor:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
Find the existing server_name line. It should look like this:

/etc/nginx/sites-available/example.com
...
server_name example.com www.example.com;
...
If it does, exit your editor and move on to the next step.

If it doesn’t, update it to match. Then save the file, quit your editor, and verify the syntax of your configuration edits:

sudo nginx -t
If you get an error, reopen the server block file and check for any typos or missing characters. Once your configuration file’s syntax is correct, reload Nginx to load the new configuration:

sudo systemctl reload nginx
Certbot can now find the correct server block and update it automatically.

Next, let’s update the firewall to allow HTTPS traffic.

Step 3 — Allowing HTTPS Through the Firewall
If you have the ufw firewall enabled, as recommended by the prerequisite guides, you’ll need to adjust the settings to allow for HTTPS traffic. Luckily, Nginx registers a few profiles with ufw upon installation.

You can see the current setting by typing:

sudo ufw status
It will probably look like this, meaning that only HTTP traffic is allowed to the web server:

Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere                  
Nginx HTTP                 ALLOW       Anywhere                  
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)             
Nginx HTTP (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
To additionally let in HTTPS traffic, allow the Nginx Full profile and delete the redundant Nginx HTTP profile allowance:

sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'
Your status should now look like this:

sudo ufw status
Output
Status: active

To                         Action      From
--                         ------      ----
OpenSSH                    ALLOW       Anywhere
Nginx Full                 ALLOW       Anywhere
OpenSSH (v6)               ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Nginx Full (v6)            ALLOW       Anywhere (v6)
Next, let’s run Certbot and fetch our certificates.

Step 4 — Obtaining an SSL Certificate
Certbot provides a variety of ways to obtain SSL certificates through plugins. The Nginx plugin will take care of reconfiguring Nginx and reloading the config whenever necessary. To use this plugin, type the following:

sudo certbot --nginx -d example.com -d www.example.com
This runs certbot with the --nginx plugin, using -d to specify the domain names we’d like the certificate to be valid for.

When running the command, you will be prompted to enter an email address and agree to the terms of service. After doing so, you should see a message telling you the process was successful and where your certificates are stored:

Output
IMPORTANT NOTES:
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/your_domain/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2022-06-01.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.

If you like Certbot, please consider supporting our work by:
* Donating to ISRG / Let's Encrypt: https://letsencrypt.org/donate
* Donating to EFF: https://eff.org/donate-le
Your certificates are downloaded, installed, and loaded, and your Nginx configuration will now automatically redirect all web requests to https://. Try reloading your website and notice your browser’s security indicator. It should indicate that the site is properly secured, usually with a lock icon. If you test your server using the SSL Labs Server Test, it will get an A grade.

Let’s finish by testing the renewal process.

Step 5 — Verifying Certbot Auto-Renewal
Let’s Encrypt’s certificates are only valid for ninety days. This is to encourage users to automate their certificate renewal process. The certbot package we installed takes care of this for us by adding a systemd timer that will run twice a day and automatically renew any certificate that’s within thirty days of expiration.

You can query the status of the timer with systemctl:

sudo systemctl status snap.certbot.renew.service
Output
○ snap.certbot.renew.service - Service for snap application certbot.renew
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/snap.certbot.renew.service; static)
     Active: inactive (dead)
TriggeredBy: ● snap.certbot.renew.timer
To test the renewal process, you can do a dry run with certbot:

sudo certbot renew --dry-run
If you see no errors, you’re all set. When necessary, Certbot will renew your certificates and reload Nginx to pick up the changes. If the automated renewal process ever fails, Let’s Encrypt will send a message to the email you specified, warning you when your certificate is about to expire.
setting up the pipeline:
Trigger on each push to main branch
Build and verify the code
Send the result to a server via rsync
The complete GitHub workflow will look like this:

  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: 12.x
    
    - name: Sync
